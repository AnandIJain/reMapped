# remapped
The general concept of remapped is to rework the University of Chicago shuttle system so that it is optimized for maximum ridership and minimum wait time. 


# code
The code is misc files related to gathering data on transit information.
Currently, there is a train coordinate retriever in trains.py, but you need to get an API key from CTA data portal.
